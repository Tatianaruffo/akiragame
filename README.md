# Time Machine

Time Machine is a quiz game developed as a a Project 3 for Code Instituteâ€™s Full-Stack Web Development course.

The idea of the game is that the user enters a Time Machine which will travel to different historic moments of the world.
The user needs to guess all the answers correct in order to go back to the present(2023).

## How to Play
 1. - In the beginning of the game you will be asked to enter your username, choose a name and press enter.

 2. - The game will load and you will get 6 different questions with 3 answer options (a,b or c).<br>Answer the questions with the letter which has the correct answer.

 3. - Answer all the questions then you will see your total score. <br>If you get all 6 questions right you'll receive a Well Done message.

 4. - You can repeat the game or finish it.


## User Experience

### Project Goals
 - Develop a quiz game using Python
 - Present the quiz in a clean and easy to understand manner
 - Keep good UX principles regarding colours/interaction
 - Robust Python code without issues/bugs
 - Provide the user some knowledge about important historic facts

### User expectations

* Easy to play, fun quiz game
* Able to quickly understand the purpose of the game
* Able to find instructions
* Wants to know their progress during the game
* Able to have another try on the game or end it 


## Features

### Application Elements

The below elements are available to be experienced by the user across the quiz game application as a whole.

### Welcome Logo

* Quote and ASCII art

![Welcome Logo](docs/WelcomeLogo.JPG)

### Introduction and instructions 

* Shows the story of the game, the rules and asks for the username 

![Introduction](docs/introduction.gif)

## Validation

### PYTHON

Code Institute's [Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was the main resouce during the code validation process. The relevant code passes with overall success with occassional minor warnings.

## Technologies Used

#### Language Used
  - Python: to develop the program.

#### Python Modules
  - [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=os#module-os) - to clear the screen.
  - [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html?highlight=sys#module-sys) - to create Typing_print effect
  - [time](https://pypi.org/project/time/) - to add pauses at certain points during the quiz.
  - [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) for adding a colour to the different parts of quiz.

#### Frameworks and Programs used

This Project used:

  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/) to store the project files.
  - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/about) to deploy the website.
  - [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) to create the flow chart.

## Deployment

### Creating the Repository

I have used the [Code Institute Python Essentials Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) 
for creating a terminal where my Python code will generate its output. The steps were as follows:

- Click the Use this template button
- A New Repository page will appear, write a Repository name and a short description and press Create repository from template
- Press the green Gitpod button to create your project workspace and start developing your website

### Deploying on Heroku

- Create an account and login into Heroku website
- Click "New -> Create new app" button
- Insert your app's Name and Choose your region then click the "Create App" button
- Into the Settings tab go to "Config vars" section and click "Reveal Config Vars"
- Enter the PORT in the KEY section and 8000 for its value, then click "Add"
- Go to "Buildpacks" section and click "Add buildpack"
- Firstly add the Python buildpack then NodeJs
- Into the Deploy tab go to "Deployment method" and select Github
- After that go to "App connected to GitHub" and look for your GitHub repository name to link it
- You can now choose to either manually or automatically deploy your app to Heroku
- I chose manually deploy
- Manual deploys means your app will be updated only when you manually click to deploy it
- When the deploying is finished, a link will be provided to you for accessing your app

  <tr>
    <td>The terminal has no issues and is working properly</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The input for name has the right behaviour and shows the user an alert if the input has unexpected characters</td>
    <td>Yes</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The quiz restarts at the name input section(not at the welcome message) if the user decides to run it again</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Manual testing

I have carried out the following manual tests throughout the development process:

  - Given invalid input at each input stage to check invalid data is dealt with in the way I expected.
  - Tested in my local terminal and the deployed Heroku terminal.
  - Asked friends and family to play the quiz to check that it works on various browsers and that the quiz functionality is understandable.
